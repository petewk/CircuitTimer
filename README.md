# CIRCUITS Interval Training Timer ðŸ‘‹

App built to try and make tracking your circuit training simpler. No need to remember which exercises go next or to restart a stopwatch between exercises.

Simply pick the exercises and the order you want and start the timer.
The screen will show which exercise you should currently be doing, the next upcoming activity, and the time remaining. When the timer runs out it will flash, vibrate, and play a customizable sound to let you know it's time to change
